# Java Algorithms & Data Structures: Mastering Efficiency

This repository is dedicated to mastering algorithms, data structures, and their time and space complexities (Big O) using Java. It's a comprehensive learning project designed to help with:

Understanding core algorithmic principles like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, backtracking, and more.
Mastering data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
Analyzing Big O complexity to improve code efficiency in terms of time and space.
Solving real-world coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and others.
Exploring concurrency in Java with examples of multi-threading, synchronization, and parallel processing.
Learning design patterns to write maintainable and scalable code.
