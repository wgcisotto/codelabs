# **Java Algorithms & Data Structures: Mastering Efficiency**

## **Description**
This repository is dedicated to mastering **algorithms**, **data structures**, and their **time and space complexities** (Big O) using Java. It's a comprehensive learning project designed to help with:

- **Understanding core algorithmic principles** like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, backtracking, and more.
- **Mastering data structures** such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Analyzing Big O complexity** to improve code efficiency in terms of time and space.
- **Solving real-world coding challenges** from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and others.
- **Exploring concurrency** in Java with examples of multi-threading, synchronization, and parallel processing.
- **Learning design patterns** to write maintainable and scalable code.
